# Ud-Data-Wrangle
Repo to tracking progress through Udacity's Data Wrangling course

The highlight of this Data Wrangling course can be found in the WeRateDogs folder. The folder contains a jupyter notebook project labeled wrangle_act where Twitter Data from WeRateDogs was extracted, cleaned, and analyzed. The folder contains additional csv's, a dataframe creator that gathered json objects from Twitter's API, and two written reports that demonstrate the ability to commuicate my findings.
